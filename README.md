## 🛠️ How to Use

Clone the repo, pick a file, and run it:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Most scripts expect input via `stdin`, just like HackerRank. You can tweak them to use hardcoded values for quick testing.

## ✍️ My Approach

I aim for:

- **Clarity**: readable code with meaningful variable names  
- **Efficiency**: minimal time and space complexity  
- **Scalability**: solutions that handle edge cases and large inputs  

Each solution is a mini case study in thinking clearly under constraints.
