# 🚀 Problem Solving Playground

Welcome to my digital dojo of algorithmic battles and brain teasers. This repository is where I sharpen my coding skills, one HackerRank challenge at a time. Whether you're here to learn, peek at solutions, or just curious—grab a seat and let's dive in.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I believe problem solving is the heartbeat of programming. It's not just about syntax—it's about strategy, clarity, and creativity. This repo is my way of:
- Practicing for coding interviews 🧑‍💻
- Exploring different problem-solving techniques 🔍
- Building muscle memory for clean and efficient code 💪

## 🧩 What's Inside

Each file is a solved HackerRank challenge, mostly in Python. Some are warmups, others are brain-benders. Here's a taste:

| Challenge                | Category        | Status  |
|--------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Apple and Orange         | Implementation  | ✅ Done |
| Birthday Cake Candles    | Warmup          | ✅ Done |
| Mini-Max Sum             | Warmup          | ✅ Done |
| Time Conversion          | Strings         | ✅ Done |
| Grading Students         | Implementation  | ✅ Done |
| Plus Minus               | Warmup          | ✅ Done |

More coming soon—I'm just getting started.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Clone the repo, pick a file, and run it:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Most scripts expect input via `stdin`, just like HackerRank. You can tweak them to use hardcoded values for quick testing.

## ✍️ My Approach

I aim for:
- **Clarity**: readable code with meaningful variable names
- **Efficiency**: minimal time and space complexity
- **Scalability**: solutions that can handle edge cases and large inputs

Each solution is a mini case study in thinking clearly under constraints.
